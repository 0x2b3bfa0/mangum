Requirements Python 3.6+ Installation $ pip3 install mangum Supported Platforms Only two platforms are currently supported, but if you'd like to see others, please open an issue . AWS Lambda / API Gateway To make an ASGI application compatible with AWS Lambda & API Gateway, wrap it with the AWSLambdaAdapter : from mangum.platforms.aws.adapter import AWSLambdaAdapter from yourapp.app import app handler = AWSLambdaAdapter ( app ) # optionally set debug=True You would then need to specify <path>.handler in your AWS Lambda configuration. Note : This platform adapter can also use an optional debug argument to return unhandled errors raised by the application. It should NOT be enabled outside of development. An example application can be found here . Azure Functions Similarly as above, wrap the application with the AzureFunctionAdapter : from mangum.platforms.azure.adapter import AzureFunctionAdapter from yourapp.app import app handler = AzureFunctionAdapter ( app ) An example application can be found here . Dependencies The base install does not have any hard requirements, but there are dependencies required depending on platform: azure-functions - required for Azure Function support.
